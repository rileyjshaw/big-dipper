# Big Dipper

I built a hardware sequencer out of DIP switches in 2018. After a move across the country, this is all that remains:

I found my old notes in the box, so I immortalized this cursed design in software.

## About

The observable universe has about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars. A group of 10 of these switches has nearly the same number of possible configurations. How many possible configurations exist with nine rows hooked together? Let’s put it like this. Imagine each star in our universe contains its own universe full of stars. And in each one of those sub-universes, each star contains a universe full of stars… and so on, to a depth of 5 layers. We’re getting closer, but we’re still a factor of 10 billion short.

This machine is full of almost limitless songs. Your job is to discover them 💫
