# Big Dipper

I built a hardware sequencer out of DIP switches in 2018. After a move across the country, this is all that remains:

I found my old notes in the box, so I immortalized this cursed design in software.

## About

The observable universe has about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars. A single one of these rows has nearly the same number of possible configurations. How many possible configurations exist with eight rows hooked together? Let’s put it like this. Imagine each star in our universe contains its own universe full of stars. And in each one of those sub-universes, each star also contains its own universe full of stars. We’re getting closer… but we’re still about one trevigintillion stars short.

This machine is full of almost limitless songs. Your job is to uncover them 💫
